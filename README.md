# HexsaLab-JavaDesignPattern
#### In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
## Creational Design Pattern
#### Creational design patterns are used to design the instantiation process of objects. The creational pattern uses the inheritance to vary the object creation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
1. Singleton
2. Abstract Factory Method
3. Builder
4. Factory Method
5. Prototype
## Structural Design Pattern
#### Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. As a simple example, consider how multiple inheritance mixes two or more classes into one.
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy
## Behavioral Design Pattern
#### Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. 
1. Command
2. Interpreter
3. Iterator
4. Mediator
5. Chain of Responsibility
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
11. Visitor
